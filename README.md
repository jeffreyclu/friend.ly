#friend.ly

friend.ly is an app to help people make new Event Buddies.

What is an Event Buddy?

Like many other introverts, I suffer from social anxiety and often find it hard to make new friends. I will often want to do things alone, but occasionally I wish that I had someone whose ear I could talk off after watching an epic movie or seeing an insane live performance. That someone, my friend, is an Event Buddy.

How does it work?

Sign up for a free account, indicating your current city and your primary interest. friend.ly will match you with any users in your city that also share the same primary interest. You can choose to meet with or skip all your potential matches. If you both choose to meet, you will be able to initiate a conversation with your new Event Buddy!

I'm sold! How do I sign up?
